Welcome to slipshow's documentation!
====================================

.. warning::
   Slipshow is under heavy modifications: it now includes a compiler from markdown to a standalone slipshow presentation!

   The documentation isn't yet up-to-date. You can have a look `here <http://choum.net:8085>`_ for some preliminary information.

Slip is an engine for displaying an enhanced version of slides, called slips. You will write ``html`` files and display the slipshow in a browser. We advise you to start by reading the :ref:`tutorial`. You can also peek at the :ref:`examples`.
